	       <h1>Hello.</h1>
	       <p>Mark Boulton design was a small design studio. In 2014,
	         we <span class="bluedemon">were aquired by Monotype</span>.</p>
	       <p>Over the years, we<span class="bluedemon">built an amazing team</span>
	         and worked on some<span class="bluedemon">tremendous projects
	         with the smartest clients</span>. That's something we're proud of, and
	         thankful for. But, it's time for a change.</p>
	       <p>The move to Monotype brings us closer to the problems
	         we want to fix. Mark Boutlon Design is now closed. The
	         team will be working on Monotype projects from the same
	         premises in the UK and we'll still be writing, blogging,
	         and still speaking at web conferences. We're not going
	         anywhere.</p>
